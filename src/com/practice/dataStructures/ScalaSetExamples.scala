     * Scala Set is a collection of pairwise different elements of the same type. In other words,
     * a Set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements. There are two kinds of Sets,
     * the immutable and the mutable. The difference between mutable and immutable objects is
     * that when an object is immutable, the object itself can't be changed.
     *
     * By default, Scala uses the immutable Set. If you want to use the mutable Set, you'll have
     * to import scala.collection.mutable.Set class explicitly. If you want to use both mutable
     * and immutable sets in the same collection, then you can continue to refer to the immutable
     * Set as Set but you can refer to the mutable Set as mutable.Set.
     *
     * Here is how you can declare immutable Sets âˆ’
     * // Empty set of integer type
     * var s : Set[Int] = Set()
     *
     * // Set of integer type
     * var s : Set[Int] = Set(1,3,5,7)
     *
     * or
     *
     * var s = Set(1,3,5,7)
